# SingularityNET

SingularityNET is a decentralized marketplace for Artificial Intelligence (AI). The business value of AI is becoming clearer each day; however, thereâ€™s a significant gap between the people developing AI tools (researchers and academics) and the businesses that want to use them. Most organizations need a more customized solution than what a single AI project can offer, and research projects oftentimes have trouble accessing a large enough data set to build effective machine learning. SingularityNET closes these gaps.

### Collaboration
In a recent talk between Ben Goertzel (founder of SingularityNET) and Charles Hoskinson (CEO of IOHK) a collaboration between the SingularityNET as well as the Cardano Ecosystem was stated.
