Konfidio is a Blockchain Venture Studio located in Berlin accelerating the journey to a sustainable, decentralized future offering a variety of solutions.

### Collaboration
> Konfidio’s strategy is based on global decentralized platforms unlocking value across the global economy. After having researched all the Turing-complete blockchains, we believe the third generation blockchain of Cardano is best-placed to ensure the stability and business continuity of real-life business models. We are working with both global corporates and the German Mittelstand and will use Cardano’s revolutionary dual-layer architecture in developing complex Turing-complete transaction platforms. This strategic partnership will help the development of real-world Cardano-based applications. We will also be able to provide young entrepreneurs with a combination of business model expertise and state-of-the-art third generation blockchain as an option for their future startups. Our aim is to increase the understanding of the protocol in both corporate and startup environments and accelerate value-add for both Cardano, the blockchain community and our clients.
> Dr. Mervyn G. Maistry, Founder and CEO of Konfidio
