GimbaLabs is a collaborative platform for people who want to show the world what Cardano can do. GimbaLabs is creating free and open source tools, lessons, and resources that people can learn from.

### Collaboration
GimbaLabs is building a platform for sharing APIs and CSKs that allow users to share experiences about what works, what they've learned, and how to improve our open source resources. Community members will also be able to contribute their own APIs and CSKs, supporting our intention to make GimbaLabs a valuable resource for the Cardano commons.
